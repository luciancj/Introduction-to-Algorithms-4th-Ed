## Step 1
Efficiency can be measured against any limited resource. In computing, possible measures of efficiency would be hard drive space used, RAM used, CPU temperature, number of operations performed by the CPU, server costs, number of requests to an external server, number of clicks a user must make, etc.

In other domains the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in other types of resources. In transportation, it could gallons of fuel. In logging, it could be trees felled per day. In doing your homework, it could be how quickly you get through each exercise on average. The number of possible ways to measure efficiency is practically endless.

## Result
It depends on the domain. A few in the domain of computer algorithms are RAM used, server costs, and FLOPS (floating-point operations per second).
