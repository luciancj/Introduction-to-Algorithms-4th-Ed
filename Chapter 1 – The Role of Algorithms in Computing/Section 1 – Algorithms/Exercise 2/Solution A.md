## Step 1

There are various criteria used as a measurement of efficient software; these include,
- **Space usage** that contains memory utilization.

Software that uses less memory would be compatible for economic devices with lower memory, and would, therefore, yield better sales. It would be, even, reflected on the speed of execution because the software might be suspended until there is available memory for it. Space usage includes other storage requirements like hard drive requirement.
- Bandwidth requirement and utilization that is an element of **network utilization**.

Just like space usage, the less the software uses a network the better it is because it would not wait until the network is available.
- The number of database transactions per second and their type, or generally **database requirement**.

Again, the software would not wait for the database until it is available to serve its request.
- Special **hardware requirement**, like whether using specific pieces of computation or a general one.

special hardware may yield a great enhancement to the speed, but it would increase the price.
- Programming languages.

In real-world challenges, you may prefer one programming language to another one for various reasons like the available support.
- Simplicity and readability.

You may think something like simplicity has nothing to efficiency because it would not enhance the speed---it may even decrease the speed of execution. Simpler solutions are popular and efficient because anyone can understand it and, therefore, add more features in less development time, which is a lot better for business goals than complex solutions that may be ready after years of development. For some applications, Java is more popular than C++ regardless that C++ has a great speed advantage over Java.
- Maintainability and better design.

Tightly related to the previous point, software that is not maintainable is very bad for business. A good design would enable better maintainability and less development time to add more features.

## Step 2
Of course, there are a lot of efficiency criteria other than these including **development time**, better to be little, and other unobvious criteria, yet we mentioned the most common, other than the speed.

## Result
- **Space usage** that contains memory utilization.Bandwidth requirement and utilization that is an element of **network utilization**.
- The number of database transactions per second and their type, or generally **database requirement**.
- Special **hardware requirement**, like whether using specific pieces of computation or a general one.
- Programming languages.
- Simplicity and readability.
- Maintainability and good design.
- Development time.
