## Step 1

As we know, the **sorting technique** is used in many fields or in society. If we should describe one that requires determining the **shortest distance** between two points, it can be **maps applications**. When we open the map application and write the destination address, it will show us some possible vehicles to reach the destination. They can be these options:
- **On foot**
- **By bus or train**
- **By car**

## Step 2

If we choose **by bus or train** option it will show the shortest distance to the destination address according to the bus and train routes. It gives priority to the routes according to the time spent on travel, not the shortest distance.

## Step 3

But if we choose **on foot or by car** options, it shows the shortest distance according to the way on the map. The process of choosing the best route happens in this way:

1. _Map application_ starts to track the route to the destination address. If the road is divided into **multiple ways**, the application will track all of them.
2. These divided roads can be also divided in some ways. This _application_ tracks all these possibilities till it reaches the destination address.
3. After reaching the destination, this _map application_ compares all these possibilities and chooses the best one according to the shortest distance.
